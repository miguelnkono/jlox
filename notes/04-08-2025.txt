Ways a language implementation can execute the code of the user is by: 
	* compile it to machine code;
	* translate it to another high-level language;
	* reduce it to some bytecode for used in a virtual machine.
But we can also execute the syntax tree itself and that's exactly what we are going to do.

When evaluating, we need answers for these two questions:
	* what kind of value do we produce?
	* how are we going to organize the code that is going to evaluate the syntax tree?

For this implementation of the Lox language, we are going to use the 'java.lang.Object' class
to hold the value and the type of variable in Jlox(which is the implementation of the Lox language in Java).

		Lox type				Java representation
		Any lox value			Object
		nil						nul
		number					Double
		boolean 				Boolean
		string 					String
