- An 'expression' is a piece of code that 'evaluate' to a value.
- A 'statement' is a complete portion of code that 'performs' an action.

An 'expression statement' is when we use an expression to create a statement. It's like when we call a function in C and pass its result to a variable. There
we are creating an expression statement. Example: int foo = Foo(); This is an expression statement.
