                The expression problem

The expression problem is when we try to find the best way to add types and operations to a system easily.
To overcome this problem, we will use in our scanner the 'Visitor pattern' design pattern.

                Visitor pattern

The visitor pattern is all about approximating the functional style within an OOP language.
It lets us add new operations easily for multiple types.
Using this pattern, we define how the new operation will behave on a set of types in one place without
touching the types themselves.
It does this by adding a new layer of 'indirection'.
