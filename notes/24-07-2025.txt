This is JLox, a subset of the Lox programming language implemented in Java,
 the programming language that I am going to programme to learn how
compiler and scanner are made.

I am Nkono Ndeme Miguel, an engineer at IAI-Cameroon doing System stuff.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

First program in Lox language looks like this:
    print "Hello, world!";

There are two main ways of managing memory:
    * reference counting
    * tracing garbage collection (garbage collection or GC)
In JLox we are going to implement tracing garbage collection to manage the memory allocated
for objects cycle.

A token contents:
    * lexeme
    * tokenType
    * tokenLiteral
    * tokenLine


The grammar used in the scanner is called: 'regular language'.
The grammar used in the parsers is called: 'context-free grammar (CFG).'.
A CFG takes a set of atomic species that it calls 'alphabet' then defines a set of 'string' that are
in that grammar. Each string is a sequence of 'letters' in the 'alphabet'.

A Grammar is a finite set of 'rules' that is used to generate an infinite set of 'strings'.
A 'derivation' is a 'string' produced using a rule of the grammar.
A 'production' is a rule of the grammar.

Each 'production' in a grammar has a 'head'(its name) and a 'body'(what it generates). The body of
a production is simply a list of symbols and each symbol comes in two flavors:
    * 'terminal' which is a 'letter' of the 'alphabet', terminal can no longer produce anything for the string.
    * 'nonterminal' which is a named reference to another 'rule'(production) in the grammar.
We can have multiple rules with the same name and when we hit the nonterminal rule referencing them, we
can choose one of those multiple rules.

We will use the 'Backus-Naur form (BNF)' to represent our grammar.
