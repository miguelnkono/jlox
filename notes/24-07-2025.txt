This is JLox, a subset of the Lox programming language implemented in Java,
 the programming language that I am going to programme to learn how
compiler and interpreter are made.

I am Nkono Ndeme Miguel, an engineer at IAI-Cameroon doing System stuff.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

First program in Lox language looks like this:
    print "Hello, world!";

There are two main ways of managing memory:
    * reference counting
    * tracing garbage collection (garbage collection or GC)
In JLox we are going to implement tracing garbage collection to manage the memory allocated
for objects cycle.

A token contents:
    * lexeme
    * tokenType
    * tokenLiteral
    * tokenLine
