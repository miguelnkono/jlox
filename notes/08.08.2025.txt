        - Environment
It is like a map where the keys are the variable and the value are the variable's value.

I just discovered that maps were primarily called 'scatter tables'.

                    expression     → assignment ;
                    assignment     → IDENTIFIER "=" assignment
                                   | equality ;


        - Scope
A scope define a region where a variable maps to a certain entity. Multiple scopes enable the same name to refer to
different things in different context.

JLox is statically scope.
“Lexical” comes from the Greek “lexikos” which means “related to words”. When we use it in programming languages,
it usually means a thing you can figure out from source code itself without having to execute anything.

In a C-ish syntax like Lox’s, scope is controlled by curly-braced blocks. (That’s why we call it block scope.)

this is the new grammar with the block scope supported:
        statement      → exprStmt
                       | printStmt
                       | block ;

        block          → "{" declaration* "}" ;
